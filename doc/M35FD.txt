MACKAPAR 35 floppy Drive

 The M35FD is a simple floppy drive.
 
 ID: 0x4FD524C5
 Manufacturer: 0x1EB37E91 (MACKAPAR)

 When the drive receive a msg he read his command into the A register:
 
 COMMAND        HEX         ACTION
  
   POLL         0x0      Write informations about the state of the 
                         drive on B and C registers : B->State C->Error
  
    SET 
  INTERRUPT     0x1      Do nothing, but in futur may be ;) 

  READ SECTOR   0x2      Begin to read an entire sector number x (X register) and 
                         copy it on the dcpu ram at the address (Y register) 
                         During the reading the dcpu continue to run and the Drive
                         Cannot receive read/write commands (State : Busy) 
                         It's take at least 1668 cycles to read a sector
 
  WRITE SECTOR  0x3      Begin to write an entire sector from the dcpu ram at the 
                         address (Y register) and copy it to the sector number x 
                         (X register)  
                         During the writing the dcpu continue to run and the Drive
                         Cannot receive read/write commands (State : Busy) 
                         It's take at least 1668 cycles to write a sector

  GET NUMBER    0x4      Do nothing, but in futur may be ;) 
    TRACKS 

During the poll the drive write state and error on B and C register
Here is the list of all possibles codes
The States are :
  State         HEX        Description 

 NO MEDIA       0x0        There is no floppy in the drive
 
   READY        0x1        The drive is ready to read/write the floppy

  READY WP      0x2        The drive is ready to ONLY read the floppy 
  
   BUSY         0x3        The drive is busy either reading or writing a sector


The Errors ares:
  Error         HEX        Description
 
  NONE          0x0        No error since the last poll

  BUSY          0x1        Drive is busy performning a action
 
  NO MEDIA      0x2        Attempted to read or write without a floppy

  PROTECTED     0x3        Attempted to write to a protected floppy
 
  EJECT         0x4        The floppy was ejected while was reading/writing 
 
  BAD SECTOR    0x5        The requested sector is broken, the data on it is lost

  BROKEN        0xFFFF     There's been some major software/hardware problem. 
                           Try to do a hard reset the device

 File structure must be like this :

 SECTOR_SIZE: 512 Bytes
 SECTORS_PER_TRACK: 18
 

 Header:
 Type = 'F' (Floppy image)
 Version = 1
 This kind of header will allow future upgrades and if we need diferent
 data files (cassetes, tapes, hard disk, etc...), we will share the same
 basic header.

 Floppy data:
 Tracks : Number of tracks, should be 40,80 or 160, I don't expect any other
 track size.

 Data: RAW data. To access a particular sector, you only need to read at
     (4 + sector * SECTOR_SIZE)
 
 BitMap:
 The bitmap stores 8 sectors state in each byte. It uses the MSB bit for 
 the lowest sector and LSB for the bigger sector.
 To read is a particular sector is bad, you read the byte at
     ( (4 + Size of Data secction) + 
         (sector /8 ) & 128 >> (sector % 8) ) != 0
 The RAW data will be read/write directly to the file, but the bitmap will
 be keep in RAM for quick read of it.

 Note: a 3"5 floppy have only 80 tracks but 2 faces (so 160 tracks)
 In out case the double face of the floppy is not emulated so to have a
 1.44MB like real 3"5 floppy we simply 2x the number of tracks -> 160
