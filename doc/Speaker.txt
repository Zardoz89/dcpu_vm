    This hardware can generate beeps with variable frequency between 1 to 
    10Khz. The amplitude is fixed.


Interrupt Behavior:
    When a HWI is received, register B is read and sets the desired frecuency 
    to be generated.i If the value in B is 0, that genration of sound is turned
    off (which is the default state assumed at start-up). Any value bigger that
    10000 is converted to 10000.
