DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name:         PC-Style Speaker
    ID:           0x02060001
    Version:      1
    Manufacturer: 0x5672746B  (VARTOK_HW)


Description:
    This hardware can generate beeps with variable frequency between 1 to 
    10Khz. The amplitude is fixed.


Interrupt Behavior:
    When a HWI is received, register B is read and sets the desired 
    frequency to be generated. If the value in B is 0, that generation of
    sound is turned off (which is the default state assumed at start-up). 
    Any value greater than 10000 is converted to 10000.
