DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: CGM1084 - Colour Graphics Monitor
    ID: 0x7349043c, version: 0x1084
    Manufacturer: 0x0ca0fe84 (INVESTRONICS)
 
 
Description:
    The CGM1084 is a 256x192 pixel colour display compatible with the DCPU-16.
    It have some display modes. Modes 0 to 3 uses a bit-plane of 256x192 to set 
    pixels in on/off state. Modes 4 and 5 are text only modes.
    The mode 0, 1 and 2 uses an attribute cell grid to set the color attributes
    of the foreground (on pixel) and background (off pixel) of groups of pixels
    in screen. Additionally each cell in mode 0 and 1, have to blink and 
    underline flags.
    The mode 3, is a B&W mode were only two colors can be configured for the all
    screen.
    The modes 4 and 5 handles only text and have blink and underline attributes.
    Can't access directly the pixels.
    
 
Interrupt behaviour:
    When a HWI is received by the GCM1084, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
 
 
    0: MEM_BITPLANE_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video bitmap ram to DCPU-16 ram 
       starting at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
    1: MEM_ATTRIBUTE_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video attribute ram to DCPU-16 ram
       starting at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
    2: MEM_MAP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and maps the palette ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of palette ram.
       If B is 0, the default palette is used instead.
    3: SET_BORDER_COLOR
       Reads the B register, and sets the border colour to palette index
       B & 0x1F
    4: SET_VIDEO_MODE
       Reads the B register, and sets the desired video mode. The only valid
       mdoes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Any other value will set video mode 0. 
       Every time that the CGM is activated, the video mode is setted to 0.
    5: GET_VIDEO_MODE
       Set the B register value to the actual video mode.
    6: MEM_DUMP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and writes the default palette data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B.       
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 64 cycles
    7: MEM_DUMP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and writes the default font data, for the actual 
       video mode, to the DCPU-16 ram starting at address B. It only works in
       Text modes.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 64 cycles
    8: MEM_MAP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and maps the font ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of font ram. It only works in
       Text modes.
       If B is 0, the default font is used instead.
 
 
Activation:
    In order to get the CGM to work, you need to set the BITPLANE and ATTRIBUTE
    pointers. When both pointer are setted, the screen will take 2 seconds to 
    be ready to display.
 
 
Video ram:
    The CM1084 has no internal video ram, but rather relies on being assigned
    an area of the DCPU-16 ram. This video ram is divided in two sections, a 
    pixel bit-plane and a attribute map. The size of the bit-plane area is of 3072
    words in graphics mode. The size of the attribute ram have a variable size 
    that depends of the video mode.
 
 
Video modes:
    Mode 0: Graphics 
       256x192 linear bit-plane, with 64x24 cells of 4x8 pixels.
       64 colors palette.
    Mode 1: Graphics
       256x192 linear bit-plane, with 32x24 cells of 8x8 pixels.
       64 colors palette.
    Mode 2: Graphics
       256x192 linear bit-plane, with 32x96 attribute cells of 8x2 pixels. 
       64 colors palette.
    Mode 3: Graphics
       256x192 linear bit-plane. 2 colors selectable from the palette for
       the all screen.
    Mode 4: Text only
       256x192 text mode of 64x24 cells of 4x8. 64 colors palette.
    Mode 5: Text only
       256x192 text mode of 32x24 cells of 8x8. 64 colors palette.
 
 
Bit-plane ram:
    The bit-plane section is a bit-plane of ON/OFF status of each pixel of the screen.
    
    Mode 0, 1, 2 and 3:
    The bit-plane in this mode is linear, being the MSB bit of the first word,
    the pixel (0,0), and the LSB bit of the same word, the pixel (0,15).
 
    Text Modes:
    Instead of a bitplane, the CGM expect to find a packed character matrix of 
    64x24 in  mode 4, or 32x24 in mode 5. The packed character are in this
    bit format :
        CCCCCCCCcccccccc
    The lowest octect (cccccccc) select the first character. The highest octect
    (CCCCCCCC) select another character. For example, if the first word
    contains 0x6F48, it will displayed in screen the characters 0x48 'H' and
    0x6F 'o' being the 'H' in row 0, column 0 and 'o' in row 0, column 1.
 
 
Attribute ram:
    The attribute section describes the color of the foreground and background
    of each cell. In Mode 3, only contains a word that defines the foreground
    and background colors of the whole screen.
 
    Mode 0, Mode 1 and Mode 2:
    Each cell is defined by a word. Each word have this bit format:
       15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
       -----------------------------------------------
        0  0  0  0  f  f  f  f  f  f  b  b  b  b  b  b
    ffffff and bbbbbb select which foreground and background color to use 
    from the palette.
    Note: Further extensions to this standard may use the top two bits. 
    For compatibility with future devices, keep them at 0.
 
    Mode 3:
    The attribute section contains only a word, were is stored the foreground
    and background colors of the whole screen. These word have this bit format:
       15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
       -----------------------------------------------
        0  0  0  0  f  f  f  f  f  f  b  b  b  b  b  b
    ffffff and bbbbbb select which foreground and background color to use 
    from the palette.
    Note: Further extensions to this standard may use the top four bits. 
    For compatibility with future devices, keep them at 0.
 
    Text modes:
    Each cell is defined by a word. Each word have this bit format:
       15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
       -----------------------------------------------
        0  0  U  B  f  f  f  f  f  f  b  b  b  b  b  b
    ffffff and bbbbbb select which foreground and background color to use 
    from the palette. If B (bit 12) is set the cell foreground color will 
    blink. If the U (bit 13) is set, the cell will be underlined. An underlined
    cell will show a row of active pixels in his bottom.
    Note: Further extensions to this standard may use the top two bits. 
    For compatibility with future devices, keep them at 0.
  
 
Palette ram:
    The CGM1084 has a default built in palette. If the user chooses, they may
    supply their own palette by mapping a 64 words memory region with one word
    per palette entry in the 64 color palette.
    Each color entry has the following bit format (in LSB-0):
       15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
       -----------------------------------------------
        0  r  r  r  r  r  g  g  g  g  g  b  b  b  b  b
    Where r, g, b are the red, green and blue channels. A higher value means a
    lighter color.
    So the CGM1084 can select 64 colours from a set of 32768.
 
Font ram:
    The CGM1084 have default fonts for both text modes. If the user chooses, 
    they may supply their own font by mapping 512 or 1024 words of memory 
    region.
    In mode 4, the font type uses a grid of 4x8 pixels defined by two words. 
    Each octet of each word represent a column of 8 pixels, being
    the word 0, MSB octect, the first column. For example, the character F 
    looks like this:
        word0 = 1111111100001001
        word1 = 0000100100000000
    Or, split into octets:
        word0 = 11111111 /
                00001001
        word1 = 00001001 /
                00000000
    In mode 5, the font type uses a grid of 8x8 pixels defined by four words.
    Each octet of each word represent a row of 8 pixels, being the word 0, 
    MSB octect the first row. For example to display the character F :
        word0 = 0000000001111110
        word1 = 0100000001111100
        word2 = 0100000001000000
        word3 = 0100000000000000
    Or, split into octets:
        word0 = 00000000 \
                01111110
        word1 = 01000000 \
                01111100
        word2 = 01000000 \
                01000000
        word3 = 01000000 \
                00000000
