DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: LEM1803 - Low Energy Monitor
    ID: 0x7349f615, version: 0x1803
    Manufacturer: 0x1c6c8b36 (NYA_ELEKTRISKA)
 
 
Description:
    The LEM1803 is a 384x288 pixel color display compatible with the DCPU-16.
    The display is made up of 96x36 16 bit cells. Each cell displays one
    monochrome 4x8 pixel character out of 256 available. Each cell has its own
    foreground and background color out of a palette of 64 colors.
    
    The LEM1803 is fully backwards compatible with LEM1802 (0x7349f615/0x1802)
    using its LEM1802 legacy mode, but increases the resolution, font memory, 
    palette memory and colour depth.
 
    The LEM1803 starts in LEM1802 legacy mode. 
    
 
Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the LEM1803, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    0: MEM_MAP_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
       When the screen goes from 0 to any other value, the the LEM1803 takes
       about two seconds to start up. Other interrupts sent during this time
       are still processed.
    1: MEM_MAP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and maps the font ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of font ram.
       If B is 0, the default font is used instead.
    2: MEM_MAP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and maps the palette ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of palette ram.
       If B is 0, the default palette is used instead.
    3: SET_BORDER_COLOR
       Reads the B register, and sets the border color to palette index B&0xF
    4: MEM_DUMP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and writes the default font data to DCPU-16 ram
       starting at address B.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 512 cycles
    5: MEM_DUMP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and writes the default palette data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B.       
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 64 cycles
    255: LEGACY_MODE
       Switches to LEM1802 legacy mode. Resets all video, palette and font mapping. 
       The LEM1802 legacy mode is extended with a similar LEAVE_LEGACY_MODE action,
       which also occurs on A=255. 
       Each cell in LEM1802 mode takes up nine LEM1803 pixels. 
       The LEM1803 starts in LEM1802 legacy mode. 
 
 
Video ram:
    The LEM1803 has no internal video ram, but rather relies on being assigned
    an area of the DCPU-16 ram. The size of this area is 5184 words, and is
    made up two sections. The first contains all the raw text, and the second
    contains the colour. 
    The first section consists 1728 words in the following format (in LSB-0):
        CCCCCCCCcccccccc
    The lowest 8 bits (cccccccc) select a character. The highest 8 bits
    (CCCCCCCC) select another character.
    The second section consists of 3456 words in the following format (in LSB-0):
        000Bffffffbbbbbb
    ffffff and bbbbbb select which foreground and background color to use.
    If B (bit 13) is set the character color will blink slowly.
    Note: Further extensions to this standard may use the top three bits of the
    colour words. For compatibility with future devices, keep them at 0. 
 
Font ram:
    The LEM1803 has a default built in font. If the user chooses, they may
    supply their own font by mapping a 512 word memory region with two words
    per character in the 256 character font.
    By setting bits in these words, different characters and graphics can be
    achieved. For example, the character F looks like this:
       word0 = 1111111100001001
       word1 = 0000100100000000
    Or, split into octets:
       word0 = 11111111 /
               00001001
       word1 = 00001001 /
               00000000
    
 
Palette ram:
    The LEM1803 has a default built in palette. If the user chooses, they may
    supply their own palette by mapping a 64 word memory region with one word
    per palette entry in the 64 color palette.
    Each color entry has the following bit format (in LSB-0):
        0rrrrrgggggbbbbb
    Where r, g, b are the red, green and blue channels. A higher value means a
    lighter color.
